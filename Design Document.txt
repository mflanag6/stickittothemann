We as a group will meet after each class period for a “stand up” meeting progress check for approximately 30 minutes.  


To build this game, we are planning on using Unity.

We will use Trello to track and assign individual tasks.


Tasks:
* Every member of the team will design a prototype for a potential game
* The team will discuss everyone’s prototypes and play a round or level for each of the games.  
* After each game, the team will discuss all of the positives and negatives of a particular game design
* The team will decide on a design and modify the design to incorporate the lessons learned from the other prototypes
* We will create a trello that tracks all of the design tasks for the initial prototype, and assign specific tasks to each member of the team
* Create  timeline for task.  


Procedure:
Weekly team stand-up meeting after class to report on progress
Well-maintained github with each member having their own branch and group merging sessions.

Git Procedure: 
Each new feature or change should be developed on a separate branch from the master game.  
Once the change is tested and we're fairly sure it won't break anything new, it can be merged 
into the master branch for everyone to pull.  This also allows us to work on different 
aspects of the game simultaneously.
